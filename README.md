This is a simple computer specs exporter tool, that can be used to export everything from hardware information
to software installations. This can export to many destinations configured in the configuration panel. This tool was written  
with systems administrators in mind. It's purpose is to help document the running state and hardware of new or old  
machines on the network into a centralized location very quickly.

# How do I use this?
To use this tool, simply run the configuration panel. Once the configuration panel opens you will be presented with many  
different configurations that you can tweak to your desired results. You can choose to export to a specific FTP server, or  
simply export to a .txt file. You may also export to an SMB file server. SCP Linux file transfer is also included in this tool.
